# Raiseku - Alessio Mancinelli

My name is Alessio Mancinelli, I'm 24 years old and I've always had a passion for computer science. Videogames pushed me to deepen this field and to choose it as a profession. I like to deal with any project related to programming, trying to combine the aesthetic aspects with the functional ones. The fields on which I have specialized in my studies are Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, but lately I've been getting passionate about everything related to the blockchain

In my spare time I also like to make programming video tutorials.
